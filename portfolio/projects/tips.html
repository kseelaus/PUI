                <h3>Problem</h3>
                <p>Signs for Psychosis and other serious mental illnesses are often identifiable during adolescence, but these young people are often resistant to recieving treatment.</p>
                <h3>Solution</h3>
                <p>In a cross-disciplinary collaboration between researchers, therapists, and local theater makers, we designed an intervention to be approachable and stigma-free for teens and young adults by icorperating aspects of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) into an acting and improvisation class.</p>
                <p>We recruited a group of teens and young adults identified to be at incresed risk, tested this class with two cohorts, then re-visited and improved the curriculum</p>
                <h3>Contribution</h3>

                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>Schizophrenia and other psychosis disorders can be chronically debilitating for affected individuals. Some symptoms are present even before the onset of the illness, and can be used to identify individuals at heightened risk of developing a disorder.</p>
                <p>Early intervention can lead to improved long-term prognosis, but effective treatment options are still poorly understood during this stage of disease progression. Some success has been had applying CBT specifically targetting social-cognition deficits, such as emotion recognition, emotion expression, and theory of mind.</p>

                <h3>Social cognition is inadvertly addressed in conventional acting and improvisation classes, so why not try this as a way of helping at-risk young people?</h4>
            </div>
            <div class="regularContent row6">
                <h2>Aim</h2>
                <p>Few interventions have addressed social cognition or functioning in individuals at clinical risk for psychosis (CR). Theater Improvisation Training to Promote Social Cognition (TIPS) is a manualized recovery-oriented intervention based on drama therapy. We aim to describe TIPS, evaluate its feasibility and acceptability, and present a preliminary investigation of outcomes in a quasi-experimental design.</p>
                <h2>Methods</h2>
                <p>Thirty-six CR participants aged 15-25 years were ascertained from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort. Twenty-six completed the TIPS protocol: 18 weekly 2-hour small group sessions led by a theater director and actor-assistant. Participants engaged in collaborative acting and improvisation exercises. Baseline and follow-up assessments included the Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (CAINS), Structured Interview for Prodromal Syndromes, Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) and Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (CNB), which includes social cognitive tests. Acceptability was assessed using focus groups. Preliminary outcomes were compared to CR controls who were not enrolled in the study but completed follow-up assessments using the same methods.</p>

                <h1>Through four classes for teens and adults, 36 young people participated in our experimental acting intervention. </h1>
                <h2>Feedback was collected through focus groups, and the classes were generally highly enjoyable and rewarding for all volunteers.</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="regularContent row8">
                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>There were no significant differences in baseline demographics, psychosis symptoms, or cognition between those who did and did not complete the TIPS protocol. Overall, TIPS was considered feasible and acceptable among CR. Preliminary outcomes suggest that TIPS may be effective in improving positive and negative psychosis-spectrum symptoms and GAF, but not performance on social cognition tests.</p>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>TIPS is a promising and acceptable recovery-oriented intervention that may improve symptoms and functioning in CR. Larger randomized controlled trials investigating TIPS efficacy are warranted.</p>
