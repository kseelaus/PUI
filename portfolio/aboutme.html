                <h2>Hi!</h2>
                <br>
                <p>I’m a User Experience Researcher and Designer with a background in Psychology and Cognitive Development.  I am currently a student working toward a master’s degree in Human-Computer Interaction from Carnegie Mellon.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Although I’m new to the world of HCI, I have a strong understanding of human subjects’ research coordination, interview technique, and quantitative data analysis. Honing my design and programming skills has been exciting in such a challenging and nurturing environment. There’s nothing I love more than applying my creativity to solve a unique problem, and improving someone’s quality of life in the process.</p>

                <h2>It’s been an adventure...</h2>
                <br>
                <p>I grew up in the Philadelphia area and attended the University of Pennsylvania, graduating in 2014 with a degree in Biological Basis of Behavior – an interdisciplinary program encompassing biology, psychology, and neuroscience. I worked at Penn and lived in West Philly afterwards, organizing academic research studies on neurocognitive functioning, Psychosis-spectrum disorders, and novel intervention treatment.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I moved to Pittsburgh to continue my work in brain development research, and shortly thereafter started at Carnegie Mellon. I look forward to whatever comes next, and hope to apply the skills I’ve learned to building a future where technology is a positive and helpful part of the human experience.</p>

            <div id="fact1">
                <p>What am I in to that’s not UX? I go on long runs and hikes to explore, and I have completed two marathons. I like going to concerts, breweries, museums, and new restaurants. I’m in to music, vegetarian cooking, movies, and hanging out with my cat, Molly.</p>

            </div>
            <div id="fact2">
                <p>Through high school and college I sang, danced, and acted in multiple groups. I was a member of the <a href="http://www.maskandwig.com/">Mask and Wig Club</a> at UPenn, for which I acted in and wrote original sketch comedy and musical theater productions. I even directed a show and managed the cast for musical that set a new high bar for ticket revenue and critical acclaim within the historic organization.</p>

            </div>
            <div id="fact3">
                <p>I love to travel and am always looking forward to the next opportunity to explore a new place. I backpacked for a month and a half in South-East Asia after college, have spent time in Mexico assisting with sea turtle conservation, and try to attend a major music festival every year.</p>
